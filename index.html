<h1>You Pick Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><b>Last Updated: September 2, 2019</b></p>

<p>We passionately believe that each person’s data is theirs to be controlled and protected, not something to be mined and packaged to Big Data in order to sell more designer underwear.</p>

<p>That said, You Pick never collects or stores information about you. Searching for restaurants occurs locally on your own device and while You Pick may use—at your discretion—your location information to provide you with delicious dining options, we never see that information. If you want us to join you for dinner, please contact us at the email address below.</p>

<h2>PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</h2>

<p>You Pick does not gather or transmit any Personally-Identifiable Information outside of your personal device. Any user interface preferences that you set are stored in your device’s local database.</p>

<h2>BUSINESS ACQUISITION</h2>

<p>In the incredibly-unlikely event that another company backs up a dump truck full of money and acquires You Pick, this policy may be changed or amended. The same may occur if Second Geek Studios Ltd. files for bankruptcy, though that’s equally unlikely and far more sad.</p>

<h2>INDEMNIFICATION</h2>

<p>You hereby indemnify us and undertake to keep us indemnified against any losses, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, legal expenses and any amounts paid by us to a third party in settlement of a claim or dispute on the advice of our legal advisers) incurred or suffered by us arising out of any breach by you of any provision of these terms of use, or arising out of any claim that you have breached any provision of these terms of use.</p>

<h2>CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

<p>Periodically, Second Geek Studios Ltd. may, at its sole discretion, change or amend this Privacy Policy. In those instances, we plan to do so with as much transparency as possible. No one wants to read forty-two pages of legal jargon.</p>

<h2>CHANGE HISTORY</h2>

<p>2019-09-02: Published Privacy Policy. Admired alliteration. </p>
